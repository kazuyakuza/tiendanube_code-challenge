# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Agent Driven Development base project will be documented in this file.

## 2026-09-09

### Changes

#### Documentation

- **`README.md`**: Fixed broken `opencode.json` links (now point to `.opencode/opencode.json`), removed the stale `.kilo/modes/` reference, corrected the rule file count (19 → 22), and clarified that the project-info knowledge files are created during Project Info initialization.
- **`.agent/project-structure.md`**: Rewritten to reflect the current structure (`.agent/`, `.kilo/`, `.opencode/`, `docs/`).
- **`.kilo/commands/project-structure.md`** and **`.opencode/commands/project-structure.md`**: Updated the "Other folders" example to reference existing directories instead of the removed `.kilo/modes/`.

#### README: Multi-Model Setup, Getting Started and opencode Go

- **`README.md`**: Added an `## Agent Models` section recommending different models per agent (reasoning-heavy roles on the strongest model, execution roles on a fast model) for better results; added a `## Getting Started (New Project Setup)` section describing the startup flow (write the brief → set up Git → ask the planner to read the brief and initialize project info → work via TODO files or chat); added the [opencode Go](https://opencode.ai/go?ref=ZHA0GMN860) subscription to the Compatibility section.

#### README: Compatibility, TOC, Prerequisites, Getting Started and Troubleshooting

- **`README.md`**:
  - Rewrote the Compatibility section: daily use with the latest Kilo Code version, current opencode testing (settings at `.opencode/`, mainly `opencode.json`), and a paragraph on the opencode Go subscription also tested with other model providers (Grok, Gemini, custom models hosted on vast.ai).
  - Added a Table of Contents.
  - Made Git the only hard Prerequisite; the AI agent tool (Kilo Code, opencode, or any other handler app) is now a choice referencing the Compatibility section.
  - Getting Started step 3 now references [Option 1](#option-1-using-a-todo-file-recommended)/[Option 2](#option-2-direct-chat-request) instead of an inline code block; the "Note on Project Info" block was moved from "How to Start a Task" into Getting Started.
  - Added a note in "AI Agent Plans" about the fast accumulation of plan/report files (may be deleted, archived, or zipped).
  - Added a Troubleshooting section clarifying that `Bifrost` and `vscode-mcp-server` are MCP plugins to install/configure in VSCode — normally harmless thanks to the adaptive `tool-selection-priority.md` rule, which users may edit if issues appear.

## 2026-09-07

### Changes

#### OpenCode Compatibility Support

This template now supports **opencode** in addition to Kilo Code. The Kilo Code setup in `.kilo/` is untouched and fully functional; opencode runs in parallel using the shared rules in `.kilo/rules/`.

- **`opencode.json`** (moved into `.opencode/opencode.json`): `default_agent: planner`, `instructions: [".kilo/rules/*.md"]` (single source of rules — no duplication), and Kilo Code's ask-by-default `edit` guardrails translated to opencode's permission model (last-match-wins ordering).
- **`.opencode/agents/`**: Added the same 7 agent definitions as `.kilo/agents/` (planner, implementer, architector, code-reviewer, code-simplifier, docs-specialist, frontend-specialist). Frontmatter converted for opencode: `mcp: allow` dropped (not a valid opencode permission key); path references normalized to forward slashes.
- **`.opencode/commands/`**: Added the 3 workflow commands (critical-workflow, project-info-init, project-structure) as opencode commands, bound to the planner agent.
- **`tool-selection-priority.md`**: Rewritten to be environment-adaptive — prefer semantic/code-aware MCP tools when available (`vscode-mcp-server_*`, `Bifrost_*`), otherwise fall back to opencode's built-in tools. Safe for both Kilo Code and opencode.

#### .ignore + opencode-ignore plugin (`.kilocodeignore` equivalent)

- **`.ignore`**: New file mirroring `.kilocodeignore` (lock files, dependency dirs, build outputs, minified/map files, large data files, media/binary assets, IDE configs, generated docs). It is the block list for the `opencode-ignore` plugin and is honored natively by opencode's search tools (ripgrep).
- **Plugin**: `opencode-ignore@1.1.0` registered in `opencode.json` — blocks `read`/`edit`/`write`/`glob`/`grep`/`list` on matched paths (auto-installed from npm on opencode startup). `.env` reads are denied by default by opencode.

#### Sub-Agent Tool Restrictions

- **`task: deny`**: Added to `code-reviewer`, `code-simplifier`, and `docs-specialist` (implementer, architector, and frontend-specialist already had it) in both `.opencode/agents/` and `.kilo/agents/`. Sub-agents can no longer delegate work; the planner retains unrestricted `task` access.
- **`question: deny`**: Added to all 6 sub-agents in both `.opencode/agents/` and `.kilo/agents/` — questions are returned to the planner (caller) instead of being asked directly, per the Critical Workflow. The planner keeps `question: allow`.

#### Documentation

- **`AGENTS.md`**: Notes the dual-tool setup (Kilo Code `.kilo/` and opencode `.opencode/` + `opencode.json`), shared rules, and opencode's planner default.
- **`README.md`**: Added opencode to the Compatibility section; documented `.opencode/` and `.ignore`; noted the shared rules approach.

### Changes

#### Implementer JUNIOR Developer Guardrails (50% Restriction)

Introduced a 50% restriction model on the `implementer` sub-agent to drastically reduce the decisions it must take, while keeping small latitude for minor local details. Upstream planning/spec/review agents now generate junior-proof outputs that encode all structural, scope, and architectural decisions.

- **`implementer.md`**: Added JUNIOR developer persona with a `Restriction Level: 50%` section. Hard Blocks forbid modifying unrelated files, adding features/logic not in the plan, restructuring/refactoring, skipping or combining steps, and choosing between unspecified approaches. Allowed Latitude covers minor local details only (internal variable names, minor string wording, formatting). Added an Escalation Rule: when uncertain whether a decision is minor/local or structural, treat it as structural and STOP to ask the caller.
- **`architector.md`**: Added `Target Implementer: JUNIOR Developer (50% Restriction)` section. Plans must encode all structural/architectural/scope decisions; vague judgment-requiring instructions (e.g., "refactor as needed", "choose the best approach") are prohibited. If a choice between approaches exists, the plan must pick one. Only minor local details may be left to the implementer.
- **`frontend-specialist.md`**: Added `Target Implementer: JUNIOR Developer (50% Restriction)` section for both `4.1a` (spec) and `4.5a` (verification). Specs must be explicit on component boundaries, prop names/types/defaults, state management, CSS methodology/tokens/breakpoints, and API endpoints/shapes/error handling. Only minor local details may be left to the implementer.
- **`code-reviewer.md`**: Added `Implementer Restriction Check (50%)` section. Reviews now flag as defects any changes to unplanned files, added logic/features beyond the plan, unrequested refactoring, and architectural/integration decisions not in the plan. Minor local deviations inside planned work are acceptable. When in doubt, flag it.
- **`code-simplifier.md`**: Added `Implementer Constraint (50% Restriction)` section. Simplifications must not offload structural/architectural decisions to the implementer; steps must remain atomic and fully specified. Prefers explicitness over brevity.
- **`critical-workflow.md`**:
  - **Step 4.1b (Implementation Plan)**: Plan must be generated for a JUNIOR developer under 50% restriction; all structural/architectural/scope decisions encoded; vague instructions prohibited; choices between approaches must be decided in the plan.
  - **Step 4.2 (Implementation)**: States the implementer is a JUNIOR developer under 50% restriction, lists the hard blocks, and requires it to STOP and ask on plan ambiguity about structure/scope/architecture (replacing the old "Must don't take self actions/decisions" line).
  - **Sub-Task Prompt Requirements**: Template now embeds the 50% restriction language — implementer blocked from unrelated file changes, scope expansion, architectural decisions, step skipping, and unspecified approach choices; limited latitude only for minor local details; stops and asks on ambiguity.

### Changes

#### Replaces Plan Agent with Planner Agent

- Drop the use of the kilo-code/open-code native plan agent: it generates many permissions errors.
- Generates new planner agent with the same rol as the plan agent.
- Planner agent permissions: when the task tool is used in the kilo-code plugin, "some" of the permissions are inherited from the caller agent. Then, to able to respect sub-agent permissions, the planner agent has nearly all allow permissions.

## 2026-07-29

### Changes

#### Critical Workflow: Frontend Specialist Integration

- **Conditional front-end sub-steps `4.1a` and `4.5a`**: For front-end related tasks, the Critical Workflow now invokes `frontend-specialist` before `architector`.
  - `4.1a` — Front-end Technical Specification: `frontend-specialist` analyzes framework/version, component structure, contracts, styling architecture, responsive behavior, API integration, accessibility (a11y), and performance budgets; produces a spec saved to `.kilo/plans/<YYYYMMDD>-<plan-name>-frontend-spec.md`.
  - `4.1b` — Implementation Plan: `architector` consumes the front-end spec and produces the complete implementation plan.
  - `4.5a` — Front-end Verification: `frontend-specialist` verifies the implementation against the spec, reporting diffs and quality issues.
  - `4.5b` — Overall Plan Adherence: `architector` incorporates the front-end verification report and checks overall plan adherence.
- **Non-front-end tasks unchanged**: Single `architector` assignment in `4.1` and `4.5` remains the default.
- **Plan Agent pre-analysis**: Global plan now determines per task whether it is front-end related (UI, components, templates, styling, layout, responsiveness, front-end state, UI API consumption, or front-end framework files).

#### Agent Definition: frontend-specialist.md

- **Added `## Context Loading`, `## Process`, and `## Boundaries` sections**: Defines how the agent analyzes front-end tasks, produces technical specifications, and verifies implementations. Agent is bounded to specification and verification only; no application code writing or state-modifying git commands.
- **Added `## Workflow Integration` section**: Cross-references the Critical Workflow conditional steps.
- **Fixed duplicate YAML keys**: Removed duplicate `mode: subagent` and `grep: allow` entries.

#### Review & Simplification Fixes

- **Removed duplicated checklists**: Front-end analysis and verification criteria now live only in `frontend-specialist.md`; `critical-workflow.md` references them instead of repeating.
- **Clarified command wording**: Changed "run allowed build/typecheck/lint/test commands" to "run allowed verification commands" in `frontend-specialist.md`.
- **Explicit context passing**: Added notes that the Plan Agent must pass the front-end spec path and verification report to `architector` in steps `4.1b` and `4.5b`.

#### Documentation

- **Updated `README.md`**: Mermaid diagram now shows front-end conditional decision paths (`Front-end task?` → `4.1a` → `4.1b` and `4.5a` → `4.5b`).

## 2026-06-11 to 2026-07-11

### Changes

#### Agent Renames

- **Architect → Architector**: Renamed the "architect" sub-agent to "architector" across all references — agent files, workflows, rules, and TODO files (2026-07-11).

#### Critical Workflow Updates

- **Plan Agent forced to never call `plan_exit`**: Plan Agent must auto-approve plans and proceed without calling `plan_exit` (2026-07-05, 2026-07-08).
- **Code-simplifier added to step 4.3**: Code Review & Simplification step now runs both code-reviewer and code-simplifier concurrently (2026-07-05).
- **Improved plan generation and auto-approval**: Enhanced implementation plan generation and auto-approval behavior for task plans (2026-06-13, 2026-06-14, 2026-06-29).
- **Updated steps 4.4 and 4.5**: Refined the Documentation and Verification steps in the Critical Workflow (2026-06-28).
- **Enhanced context passing to sub-agents**: Plan Agent now passes more complete context (TODO path, plan path, constraints) when delegating tasks (2026-07-05).
- **Documentation workflow updates**: Refined documentation-related steps in the Critical Workflow (2026-07-09).

#### Permissions Updates

- **Agent permissions overhaul**: Updated, fixed, and re-updated agent permission rules across all agent definition files (2026-07-10).
- **Plan Agent bash access**: Updated Plan Agent permissions to allow necessary bash commands (2026-07-09).
- **Tool Selection Priority Rule updated**: Added `semantic_search` to the tool selection preference hierarchy (2026-07-09).
- **General permissions improvements**: Enhanced tool permission declarations across agent definitions (2026-06-28).

#### Project Info Improvements

- **Fixed project-info instructions**: Corrected details in the project-info instruction files (2026-06-12).
- **More frequent info file updates**: Updated project-info instructions to refresh information files more frequently (2026-07-05).

#### Minor Fixes

- **Fixed TODO file handling**: Corrected logic for how TODO files are processed (2026-06-15).
- **Git setup documentation**: Added command documentation for Git setup (2026-06-18).

## 2026-06-11

### Changes

#### Agent Permission Clarification

- Clarified tool permissions for all agent and mode definition files — each file now explicitly declares allowed tools in both the YAML frontmatter `permission` block and a `## Tools` section in the prompt body.
- Updated files: `.kilo/modes/plan.md`, `.kilo/agents/architect.md`, `.kilo/agents/code-reviewer.md`, `.kilo/agents/code-simplifier.md`, `.kilo/agents/docs-specialist.md`, `.kilo/agents/frontend-specialist.md`, `.kilo/agents/implementer.md`.

## 2026-06-01

### Changes

#### State Tracking Removed

- **Removed `.kilo/state.md`**: State tracking file deleted due to unresolvable permission conflicts in extended projects. Plan Agent no longer maintains process state between sub-steps.
- **Removed `State Tracking` section** from `critical-workflow.md`: Eliminated all state read/write references (6 occurrences).
- **Removed `On start` clause** from Task Origin step (line referencing state fields).
- **Removed `State Sync` line** from Overall Process Management.
- **Removed state update lines** from Task Completion and TODO File Completion steps.
- **Updated `kilo.jsonc`**: Removed `.kilo/state.md` from edit permissions.
- **Updated global `kilo.jsonc`**: Removed `.kilo/state.json` from `external_directory` permissions.

## 2026-05-28

### Changes

#### Custom Subagents: Architect and Implementer

- **Created `architect` subagent** (`.kilo/agents/architect.md`): `mode: subagent`, `hidden: true`, read-only + `.md` edit, no bash, no task delegation. Used for Critical Workflow step 4.1 (task analysis and implementation planning). System prompt instructs agent to read project context files before generating plans.
- **Created `implementer` subagent** (`.kilo/agents/implementer.md`): `mode: subagent`, `hidden: true`, full read/edit/bash/glob/grep access, no task delegation. Used for steps 2, 3, 4.2, 4.3-fix, 4.5, 4.6, 5. System prompt instructs agent to read `.kilo/rules/` for code standards instead of duplicating them inline.
- **Converted custom agents to subagent-only**: Changed `code-reviewer`, `docs-specialist`, `code-simplifier`, `frontend-specialist` from `mode: all` to `mode: subagent` — they no longer appear as selectable primary agents.
- **Updated Critical Workflow Sub-Agent Type Mapping**: Replaced `code` → `implementer` and `plan` → `architect` throughout `.kilo/commands/critical-workflow.md`. Added context-passing instructions requiring Plan Agent to include file paths and task context in task prompts.
- **Updated project-structure command** (`.kilo/commands/project-structure.md`): Replaced `Plan sub-agent`/`Code sub-agent` with `Architect sub-agent`/`Implementer sub-agent` and explicit `subagent_type` values.

#### Rationale

Built-in `code` and `plan` agents are primary-only and cannot be delegated via the `task` tool, causing "Agent is a primary agent and cannot be used as a subagent" errors during Critical Workflow execution. Custom subagents with `mode: subagent` resolve this while keeping project-specific context instructions in their system prompts.

## 2026-05-27

### Changes

#### Critical Workflow Sub-Agent Type Mapping

- **Explicit `subagent_type` values**: Added Sub-Agent Type Mapping table to critical workflow, mapping each step to its correct `subagent_type` parameter value (`code`, `plan`, `code-reviewer`, `docs-specialist`)
- **Replaced generic agent references**: All "Code sub-agent" and "Plan sub-agent" delegation instructions now include explicit `subagent_type` values (e.g., `subagent_type: "code"` instead of untyped delegation)
- **Updated Sub-Task Prompt Requirements**: Added mandatory check that `subagent_type` matches the Sub-Agent Type Mapping table
- **Updated Compliance Self-Check**: Added check (c) verifying correct `subagent_type` usage
- **Updated Global Plan Example**: All example entries now show explicit agent types per step, including new `4.3-fix` entry

#### README

- Fixed command template formatting: `follow /critical-workflow and full read @AGENTS.md` → `full read @AGENTS.md & follow /critical-workflow`

## 2026-05-25

### Changes

#### Critical Workflow Enforcement

- **Force Task Delegation**: All agent assignments in the critical workflow now use explicit `task` tool invocations instead of `@mentions`
  - Added CRITICAL rule: Plan Agent MUST NOT assign the entire global plan or all 4.x steps to a single sub-agent
  - Each sub-step (4.1-4.6) now requires a separate `task` tool invocation
  - Updated all workflow examples and error handling to reference `task` tool
  - Fixed typo in path templates: `<YYYYMMDD}` → `<YYYYMMDD>`

#### Configuration Changes

- **Plan Agent Prompt Externalized**: Moved Plan Agent behavior prompt from `kilo.jsonc` to dedicated `.kilo/modes/plan.md` file
  - Simplified `kilo.jsonc` to only enable plan agent; no inline prompt
  - Added `.kilo/commands/**/*.md` to instruction paths in config

#### New Rules

- **Tool Selection Priority Rule** (`.kilo/rules/tool-selection-priority.md`): Agents must prefer semantic/code-aware tools over raw file commands for code operations
- **Gitignore Compliance Rule** (`.kilo/rules/gitignore-compliance.md`): Agents must verify `.gitignore` before every commit and ensure no ignored files are staged

#### Agent Availability

- **Custom Agents Always Available**: Changed all 4 custom agents (`code-reviewer`, `code-simplifier`, `docs-specialist`, `frontend-specialist`) from `mode: subagent` to `mode: all`
- Normalized bash permission format across agent definitions

#### New File: `.kilocodeignore`

- Added `.kilocodeignore` to control codebase indexing exclusions: lock files, dependency directories, build outputs, binary/media assets, and IDE configs

#### Minor Fixes and Updates

- Updated `.agent/RULES.md`: Added links to the two new rules
- Updated `.agent/project-structure.md`: Added `.kilo/modes/` directory reference
- Updated `.agent/project-info/brief.md`: Added `.kilocodeignore` mention, fixed workflow path reference
- Updated `.kilo/commands/project-structure.md`: Replaced `@general`/`@code` mentions with `Plan sub-agent`/`Code sub-agent` and `task` tool
- Updated `.kilo/commands/project-info-init.md`: Replaced `@plan` with `/critical-workflow` command reference
- Updated `.kilo/rules/important-paths.md`: Fixed typo in plan file path template
- Updated `.kilo/rules/markdown-generation-rule.md`: Replaced `@agent` mentions with explicit agent names
